# HelloFaces

Simple JSF Demo-Project. Contains a single managed bean whose state can be altered and used for 
rendering. This is achieved with to views that are connected to each other via navigation rules.

To store the bean's state, a session is used.

For simplicity, all libraries are included as jar-files in the *lib*-Folder. This could also be 
achieved by using maven.
